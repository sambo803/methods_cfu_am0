# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel about your use of built-in Ruby methods?
   Ans.: Well, I like them and don't feel terribly uncomfortable with using them,
   but wasn't able to fully display that by absorbing it before being too tired..
   And on the pairing, choked... I know what a string is...

- How confident do you feel writing simple methods of your own?
   Ans.: Fairly so.

- What questions do you have about methods, and what they are capable of? (ask a question!!!)
   Ans.: How can I get better at using them?
